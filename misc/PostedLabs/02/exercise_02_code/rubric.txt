put the script "grade.sh" into the same folder with list.c

run the script by "sh grade.sh"

the expected result is:
1 2 6 10
2 2 6 10
2 3 6 10
2 6 7 10
2 6 10 11

compilation success gives 2 points and each test case gives 1 points




[50]-> [60] -> [70]

Inserting:  [40].  CASE: key < head.x


IF this IS the case, --- then we want to:

Assign insertingNode to point to head like so:     myNode->next = head
AND we DONT want to return head like w the other scenarios bc that's no longer the 'head' of the list
